# Beautiful-Data-Bindings

It feels amazing to completely decouple the UI from the behavior!!

This application involved using the data binding infrastructure in Xamarin.Forms to fully separate 
the UI from the underlying data models. This app displays flag data for several countries and it's
a wonderful exercise to understand data bindings in detail. Long live Xamarin!
